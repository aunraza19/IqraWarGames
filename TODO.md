# TODO

Open work for War Games. Public MIT repo under `NoblerWorks-HQ`, so anything here is
visible - keep notes accurate and free of anything internal.

Status is research/exploration: the multi-provider AI abstraction is the point of the
project, the game is the harness for it. Last commit 2026-08-31.

## Audit findings (2026-10-02)

Fleet audit follow-up; all fixed on main 2026-10-02 (local app, nothing to deploy - push to publish).

- [x] 2026-10-02 high - README quickstart pointed at :5173, Vite runs on :3000 (`README.md:36`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) - fixed.
- [x] 2026-10-02 medium - Open CORS + all-interface bind let any site or LAN host spend the user's key (`server/index.ts`) - binds 127.0.0.1 (`HOST` opt-in), 403 on foreign Origin, CORS only for the local UI, `intervalMs` clamped 5-60s; tests in `server/http.test.ts`.
- [x] 2026-10-02 medium - stop -> start mid-turn ran an old turn into the reset game (`server/engine.ts`) - generation id + `StaleTurnError`; regression test in `server/engine.test.ts`.
- [x] 2026-10-02 medium - `npm start` served no client (`server/index.ts`) - serves `dist/` with SPA fallback when built.
- [x] 2026-10-02 low - package.json said ISC, LICENSE is MIT - now MIT + author + repository.

## 🟡 Refactor survey (2026-09-18)

Found by a read-only survey of the repo on 2026-09-18; none was tracked before. Ranked by payoff for the effort. 🟠 = a real bug or risk, not only tidiness.

- [x] ~~Move the 13 `spawn*Effect` / `trigger*ScreenEffect` methods (lines 303-1080) out of the `FlatMap` class in `src/flatmap.ts` (1,226 lines) into `src/effects/*.ts` behind a small `Effect` interface. M, visual only.~~ ✅ 2026-09-18 `src/effects/{types,screen,impacts,local}.ts` behind an `EffectHost` interface; `flatmap.ts` 1,226 -> 582 lines. typecheck + build pass; all 10 effects spawned and cleared in a browser with no runtime errors.

## 🔴 Stale model defaults - public and wrong

- [x] ~~Anthropic default `claude-sonnet-4-6` -> `claude-sonnet-5` in code, `.env.example` and
      README~~ ✅ done 2026-09-17. Also stopped sending `temperature` (Sonnet 5 / Opus 5
      reject it with a 400) and send `thinking: disabled` to keep turns fast.
- [x] ~~Re-check OpenAI and Gemini defaults~~ ✅ done 2026-09-17, verified against the
      providers' model pages: OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` -> `gpt-5.6-luna` (OpenAI's named
      replacement for its small models on the deprecations page); Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash`
      -> `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (stable, same $0.30/$2.50 price point as 2.5 Flash;
      3.8 Flash is newer but 2.5x the price and cannot switch thinking off).
      GPT-5+ models now get `max_completion_tokens` + `reasoning_effort` (default `none`,
      `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT` overrides); Gemini 3.x no longer gets `thinkingBudget: 0`.
- [x] ~~Validate model ids at startup~~ ✅ done 2026-09-17. `validateProviders()` runs at boot
      for every role's provider: unknown model or rejected key refuses to start and names the
      env var; unreachable provider warns and continues; `SKIP_MODEL_CHECK=1` skips it.
- [ ] 2026-09-24: run one real game per provider with the new defaults (needs a real key for
      each) - the defaults were checked against the docs and the key-rejected path against the
      live APIs, but no turn has been played on `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` or
      `claude-sonnet-5` yet.

## 🟠 No safety net

- [x] ~~No tests at all. The turn resolver in `server/engine.ts` (combat, territory change,
      resource gain, diplomacy) is pure logic over `game/initial-world.json` and is the
      obvious place to start - it needs no API key to exercise.
      When tests land, add an `npm test` step to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.~~
      ✅ 2026-09-18 `server/engine.test.ts` (vitest, 23 tests, AI layer mocked, dice pinned):
      resource gain, move/fortify/recruit/research, combat win/draw/repel, mercenaries,
      alliances and oathbreaking, nukes, maxTurns and domination victory. `npm test` is in CI
      and in CONTRIBUTING/README.
- [x] ~~No CI, and no `.github/workflows/` at all. Once tests exist, add typecheck + lint +
      test + build on push, matching the pattern in `rocketscan/.github/workflows/ci.yml`.~~
      ✅ 2026-09-18 `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck + lint + build on push to main
      and on PRs. The test step is added with the first tests (item above).
- [x] ~~Add `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"`~~ ✅ done 2026-09-17. One `tsconfig.json` covers both
      `src/` and `server/`; it reports 0 errors. Wire it into CI when CI exists.
- [x] ~~No lint config. This is a public repo taking contributions (`CONTRIBUTING.md` exists)
      with nothing to enforce a house style on a PR.~~ ✅ 2026-09-18 `eslint.config.js`
      (ESLint 9 + typescript-eslint recommended), `npm run lint` exits 0; the 33 existing
      findings were fixed, not suppressed, except the unused `originalResources` in
      `server/engine.ts`, which is the open "irradiated for 5 turns" item below.

## 🟡 Cost and abuse surface

- [ ] Every turn calls the provider four times (three factions + narrator) every 10-15
      seconds, with no token ceiling and no cost estimate anywhere in the docs. Document the
      per-game cost of the default Gemini config in README "Cost Controls".
      (2026-09-18: the turn cap already exists - `maxTurns: 20` in `game/initial-world.json`,
      enforced at `server/engine.ts:335`, and the interval stops itself at `engine.ts:76`, so
      a game is at most 80 calls, not open-ended. README now says so.)
- [x] ~~No rate limiting or retry/backoff on provider calls - a 429 mid-turn loses the turn.~~
      ✅ 2026-09-18 `server/retry.ts` wraps all three providers' `generate()`: 429, 5xx and
      network failures retried twice (1s/2s jittered backoff, `Retry-After` honoured, 8s cap);
      401/400/timeouts are not. `server/retry.test.ts` covers it with mocked fetch (10 tests).
      No client-side rate limiter was added - the 4-calls-per-turn cadence is already bounded.
- [x] ~~Game state is in-memory only, so a server restart drops every game in progress.
      Acceptable for local play; state it in the README rather than leaving it implied.~~ ✅ 2026-09-18 README Architecture > State now says it (single GameEngine in server/index.ts, no disk writes, no save/load)

## 🟢 Game and docs

- [ ] Factions are named after real sitting heads of state. Fine for a satire piece, worth
      a deliberate decision rather than an inherited one now that the repo is public.
- [x] ~~`game/rules.md` and `game/tech-tree.json` are not referenced from the README, so the
      moddable parts of the game are effectively undiscoverable.~~ ✅ 2026-09-18 README "Modding the game" section links all of game/
- [x] ~~Nuclear exchange is in the action list and in the screenshots but has no documented
      resolution rules - the one mechanic most readers will look for.~~ ✅ 2026-09-18 README "Nuclear exchange" section, written from server/engine.ts
- [ ] engine.ts comment says a nuked territory is irradiated "for 5 turns", but nothing restores
      it: `originalResources` is saved and never used, so the yield is wiped permanently. Decide
      which is intended and fix the code or the comment (README documents current behaviour).
- [x] ~~Write TODO.md~~ ✅ done 2026-09-06
