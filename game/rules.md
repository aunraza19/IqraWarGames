## Turn Structure

Each turn, factions submit up to 3 orders (JSON format only).

### Order Types

1. **move** - Move a unit to an adjacent territory
   ```json
   {"action":"move","unit":"nato-inf-1","to":"central_america"}
   ```

2. **attack** - Attack enemy units in an adjacent territory
   ```json
   {"action":"attack","unit":"nato-inf-1","target":"scandinavia"}
   ```

3. **fortify** - Build defenses in a held territory (+2 defense)
   ```json
   {"action":"fortify","territory":"alaska"}
   ```

4. **recruit** - Raise a new unit in an owned territory
   ```json
   {"action":"recruit","type":"infantry","territory":"western_na"}
   ```

5. **trade** - Send resources to another faction
   ```json
   {"action":"trade","to":"russia","offer":{"gold":5}}
   ```

6. **spy** - Reveal fog of war on a target territory
   ```json
   {"action":"spy","target":"south_asia"}
   ```

7. **research** - Progress on tech tree
   ```json
   {"action":"research","tech":"military"}
   ```

8. **diplomacy** - Propose alliance
   ```json
   {"action":"diplomacy","to":"china","proposal":"alliance"}
   ```

## Combat Resolution

When a unit moves into or attacks an enemy territory:
1. Attacker strength = unit attack + tech bonuses
2. Defender strength = unit defense + terrain bonus + fortification bonus
3. Roll = random(1-6) + strength difference
4. Roll >= 7: Attacker wins, defender retreats or is destroyed
5. Roll 4-6: Draw, both units take 1 damage
6. Roll <= 3: Defender wins, attacker retreats

Terrain bonuses:
- Mountains: +2 defense
- Fortified territory: +2 defense
- Coast/Plains: no bonus

## Fog of War

- Each faction sees territories they control + adjacent territories
- Spy action reveals a target territory for 1 turn
- Alliance partners share vision

## Victory Conditions (first to achieve any)

1. **Domination**: Control 10+ territories (50% of globe)
2. **Economic**: Accumulate 30 Gold while holding 3+ Coast territories
3. **Diplomatic**: Form alliance with both other factions simultaneously for 5 turns

## Game Length

- Event mode: 8 turns by default (`MAX_TURNS`, see `server/config.ts`) - games are fast and aggressive
- If no victory by the last turn, highest score wins; a shared top score is a draw
- Score = (territories * 3) + (total resources / 5) + (tech levels * 2)

## Faction Order Format

CRITICAL: Factions must respond ONLY in valid JSON. Non-JSON responses are treated as a forfeit.

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {"action": "move", "unit": "nato-inf-1", "to": "central_america"},
    {"action": "recruit", "type": "infantry", "territory": "alaska"},
    {"action": "research", "tech": "military"}
  ],
  "summary": "Expanding south while building forces"
}
```

Maximum 3 orders per turn. Use territory IDs (snake_case). The `summary` field is one short public sentence.
